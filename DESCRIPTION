Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    c(person("Sean", "Kent",
             email = "skent259@gmail.com",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-8697-9069")),

             role = c("aut")))
Description: rsmatch contains popular methods for matching in time-varying
    observational studies.  Matching is difficult in this scenario because 
    participants can be treated at different times which may have an influence
    on the outcomes.
