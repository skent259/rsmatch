Description: Implements popular methods for matching in time-varying
    observational studies. Matching is difficult in this scenario because
    participants can be treated at different times which may have an
    influence on the outcomes. The core methods include: "Balanced Risk
    Set Matching" from Li, Propert, and Rosenbaum (2011)
    <doi:10.1198/016214501753208573> and "Propensity Score Matching with
    Time-Dependent Covariates" from Lu (2005)
    <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00356.x>. Some functions use the
    'Gurobi' optimization back-end to improve the optimization problem
    speed; the 'gurobi' R package and associated software can be
    downloaded from <https://www.gurobi.com> after obtaining a license.
